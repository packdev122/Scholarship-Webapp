                        Entrepreneurship is like family,<br><br>

                        Your company and your team is like your child(ren). It’s a pleasure to see it grow, you nurture it, you guide it, you discipline it, you reward it. You bear their pains. You eat drink sleep their requirements. You create the culture, personality and character of your company like your children. The pleasure is beyond words. 
                        <br><br>
                        Of course for serial entrepreneurs the second and more companies get the similar lower attention as second and later children 
                        <br><br>
                        Your Board is like your parents. You know they have wisdom, but you think you know more. They want you to weigh pros and cons and you want to rush ahead, you think they are slowing you down. Oldies!!
                        <br><br>
                        When they are there you don’t hear them. When they are gone you miss them.
                        <br><br>
                        Your investors are like your wife. All amiable during courtship and terror post marriage. Investors have the same idiosyncrasies as women. Cant argue with them on rationale. The power equation is clear. My way or highway. 
                        <br><br>
                        A rare few do get lucky and bear many children with the same wife, but for most it’s a compromise. For some living hell.
